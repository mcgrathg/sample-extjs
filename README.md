# sample-extjs
The demo is written in ExtJS 5 with placeholder data supplied by JSON Placeholder.
This app includes some custom components and features I've developed for ExtJS like:

Remembers column order and width automatically between sessions
Context-based grid row editability
Highlighting and notification of incorrect grid data
Exportability of grid data to Excel
Effortless Parent/Child grid configurations to sync lower level data with Parent grid's selection
