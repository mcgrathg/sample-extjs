# sample-extjs
The demo is written in ExtJS 5 with placeholder data supplied by JSON Placeholder.

This app includes some custom components and features I've developed for ExtJS like:
<ul>
<li>Remembers column order and width automatically between sessions</li>
<li>Context-based grid row editability</li>
<li>Highlighting and notification of incorrect grid data</li>
<li>Exportability of grid data to Excel</li>
<li>Effortless Parent/Child grid configurations to sync lower level data with Parent grid's selection</li>
</ul>
